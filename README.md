# Bevy Snake Game
This is a very simple snake game demonstration I made in Rust
using [Bevy Engine](https://bevyengine.org/). I created it to learn
ECS game development and to become more familiar with the library,
so don't expect this code to be perfect.

Check the const global variables to edit game values such as tick speed,
grid size, and window width/height.

Known Issues:
- You can go outside the game area
- No score system
